Power BI dashboard (AdventureWorks on SQL Server): executive overview, product performance, and customer revenue concentration analysis.

---

## Overview
This project is a Power BI sales analytics report built on the **AdventureWorks** dataset sourced from **Microsoft SQL Server**.  
The report focuses on three things:

- **Overall performance** (sales, orders, customers, AOV)
- **Product drivers** (top products, subcategories, revenue vs units)
- **Customer dependency risk** (revenue concentration and customer distribution)

The report is designed to be clean, executive-friendly, and interactive with slicers and cross-filtering.

## Report Pages

### 1) Executive Sales Overview
Purpose: A fast, high-level view of business health.

Includes:
- KPI cards: **Total Sales**, **Total Orders**, **Avg Order Value (AOV)**, **Total Customers**
- **Monthly Sales Trend** (time series)
- **Sales by Product Category**
- **Sales by Territory**
- **Date range slicer** (applies across the report)

---

### 2) Product Performance
Purpose: Identify what products/categories drive revenue and how volume relates to revenue.

Includes:
- **Top 10 Products by Sales**
- **Sales by Product Subcategory**
- **Category Sales Trend** (multi-line trend by category)
- **Revenue vs Units Sold (Product-level scatter)**
  - The **Category Sales Trend** is used as an interactive filter: selecting a category updates the scatter dynamically.

---

### 3) Customer Revenue Concentration
Purpose: Understand concentration risk and customer value distribution.

Includes:
- KPI cards: **Active Customers**, **Returning Customers (2+ Orders)**, **Revenue per Active Customer**, **Customers for 80% of Sales**
- **Pareto-style Revenue Concentration** chart (Top customers sorted by sales + cumulative line)
- **Customer Distribution by Revenue Band**
- **Revenue Share — Top Customers** donut chart showing revenue share of **Top N customers** (TopN selection via dropdown)

## Data Source & Extraction
The source data is stored in **Microsoft SQL Server** (AdventureWorks).  
Only the required tables/columns for analysis were loaded into Power BI to keep the model lightweight and improve refresh performance.

---

## Data Model
The model follows a star-like schema:

- **Fact tables**
  - `Sales SalesOrderHeader`
  - `Sales SalesOrderDetail`

- **Dimension tables**
  - `DimDate`
  - `Sales Customer`
  - `Production Product`
  - `Production ProductSubcategory`
  - `Production ProductCategory`
  - `Sales SalesTerritory`

- **Helper / disconnected tables**
  - `RevenueBands` (customer banding)
  - `TopN Customers` (TopN selection)
  - `RankAxis` (ranking axis support)

## Tools Used
- **SQL Server** – data source (AdventureWorks)
- **Power BI Desktop** – modeling, DAX measures, visualization, report design
- **Power Query** – selecting tables/columns and shaping during import

---

## Key DAX Measures (examples)

### Returning Customers (2+ Orders)
Counts customers who placed **at least two orders** within the current filter context (e.g., the selected date range).
Note: This measure is used on the Customer Revenue Concentration page to quantify repeat behavior.
```DAX
Returning Customers (2+ Orders) =
VAR CustOrders =
    SUMMARIZE(
        'Sales SalesOrderHeader',
        'Sales SalesOrderHeader'[CustomerID],
        "OrderCount", DISTINCTCOUNT('Sales SalesOrderHeader'[SalesOrderID])
    )
RETURN
COUNTROWS(
    FILTER(CustOrders, [OrderCount] >= 2)
)
```
### Sales (Top N Customers)

Calculates revenue generated by the Top N customers based on the current selection (TopN dropdown).
Used to power the Revenue Share — Top Customers donut chart.
```DAX
Sales (Top N Customers) = 
VAR N = [Selected TopN]
VAR CustSales =
    SUMMARIZE(
        ALLSELECTED('Sales Customer'[CustomerID]),
        'Sales Customer'[CustomerID],
        "Sales", [Total Sales]
    )
VAR TopCust = TOPN(N, CustSales, [Sales], DESC)
RETURN
SUMX(TopCust, [Sales]) 
```

### How to Use the Report

- Use the Date range slicer to change the analysis period.

- On Product Performance, click a category in Category Sales Trend to filter the Revenue vs Units Sold scatter plot.

- On Customer Revenue Concentration, adjust the TopN Customers dropdown to see how much revenue depends on the top customer group.

### Business Questions Answered

- How is overall sales performance trending over time?

- Which categories/subcategories and specific products contribute most to revenue?

- How do product revenue and unit volume relate (high revenue vs high volume products)?

- How concentrated is revenue across customers (dependency risk)?

- What portion of revenue comes from the Top N customers?

### Improvements / Next Steps

Possible enhancements if this were extended further:

- Add profitability (margin / gross profit) if cost data is available.

- Add time intelligence KPIs: YoY, MoM, rolling 12 months.

- Improve trend accuracy by excluding partial months (“last complete month” logic).

- Add drillthrough pages (customer or territory) if the dataset supports richer repeat behavior (more frequent customer histories).
